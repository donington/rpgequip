beta build 1027: first public release

  - Too many features, crash fixes and optimizations to know where
    to even begin at this point.  So this is where it begins...

  - Lots of stuff that still needs documenting, mainly:
     * How to craft the Smithing Hammer and the Superior Anvil
     * How to use the anvil with the hammer
     * Superior Anvil Recipe list
     * A brief introduction to Elites, possibly entitled
         "Elite Creatures and how they will ruin your day"


older:
  - several dozen unversioned alpha builds during initial creation
  - over two dozen beta builds leading to build 1027 (mostly unstable)
  - lots of crashes leading to many 'omg it's working first try' moments
  - generally not ready for stable server use
      (aside from a couple of miracle builds)
  - not enough functionality worthy of public release
